## Dancing landscapes

### Requirements
- Version 0.9.8 of openFrameworks installed and working. You should have tried out some of the examples in the examples folder. If you need help, ask in the forum.
- Bring headphones with you

### Contents
- Intro to shaders
- Intro to audio analysis throug ofxMaxim
- Intro to OF.

### Applications

Apps. Each app will move us a bit forward
- `emptyShaders`. Change the app and add vertex displacement.
- vertexDisplacement. Vertex displacement and RMS
- shaderOnPhyllotaxis. Shaping functions with shaders

### Todo

ideas in sparse order
- grid for a terrain
- background color gradients with shaders
- fft to texture see https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/passing-fft-audio-data-into-a-shader-as-a-texture2d-object-shadertoy/13756 and ofBufferObject in the examples. https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/packing-ofvec3f-in-offloattexture-for-glsl/17387/2
- fft to texture
- a sky with gradients, flat mountains and sun. use this example for the part where you tal about colors
- Load a model (in this example app could be a palm). Ask people to search for a model on turbosquid and to apply shaders and sound to it
- FBOs ?
