This example covers:

- [shaping functions](https://thebookofshaders.com/05/) with shaders.
- curves
- screen coordinates with shaders
- intro to phyllotaxis

Try to:
- Use different geometries instead of cubes. Explore the OF documentation and use another primitives instead ofBoxPrimitive
- Try to create two collection with 2 different geometries and apply a shader for each collection
- Play with the gui and with the shaders until you find something that you like
- Post a screenshot or a video on your socialmedia (you are not required too, but it is important to learn how to promote your work and to keep doing it).
- Try to reduce the effect of the vertex displacement on the middle of the screen, and to increase it near the border. To do this, you need the coordinate of the screen, how to to this? check shadertoy.
